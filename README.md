# Comic Sansifier

This is objectively the worst extension you will ever install.

Simply pin the extension to your browser, and click it to turn the whole webpage into Comic Sans.

When you realise you hate it, you can click it again to restore the font! (Or refresh the page - whatever is your favourite).
